Welcome to my simple NIfTI visualizer!

In order for you to flexibly visualize your own NIfTI data, you must follow these steps:

A) Create a master folder

B) Upload dimView.py to the master folder

C) Create a folder entitled "INPUT" within the master folder

D) Upload your NIfTI data to the INPUT folder

E) Ensure the following libraries are installed (using `pip install LIBRARYNAMEHERE`):
  1) `tkinter`
  2) `nibabel`
  3) `numpy`
  4) `matplotlib`

F) Run dimView.py from your command prompt (e.g., `cd MASTERFOLDERLOCATION`, then `py dimView.py` from PowerShell or CMD)
